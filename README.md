# IP Passport Studio

A web application that lets creators generate "IP Passports" for their digital content – proving ownership, timestamp, and basic licensing rules. Built as a minor project and hackathon project.

## High-level idea

- Users sign up and log in
- Users upload images, text, audio, or video
- System generates a unique fingerprint (hash) and metadata
- System stores an "IP Passport" record for each asset
- Later versions can register this on-chain using Web3 / Story Protocol
